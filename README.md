# e-ps_scattering
The code used for my PhD Dissertation at the University of North Texas. This contains S/P/D-wave elastic scattering, the binding energy of Ps-, 1/2-photon detachment of Ps-

Description of contents is as follows:  
  bound-state/ -  This contains the code to compute the binding energy of the positronium negative ion usng the Rayleigh-Ritz variational method and an expansion of short-range Hylleraas-type terms for the wave function, along with a sample input file.
